<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
	Computational Thinking is an approach that looks for solve problem through several analysis such dissolve the problem into small and easiest problems (<strong>Problem Decomposition</strong>) and find patterns to predict possible behaviors (<strong>Pattern Recognition</strong>). After trace the whole problem it's needed a well detailed step-by-step showing how to solve the problem. That step-by-step is the main pillar of the Computational Thinking and its called <strong>Algorithm</strong>. Great algorithms are written to be used multiple times and in different scenarios so they must be generalists and versatile (<strong>Abstraction</strong>).

	All the concepts above are rudimentary in the Computational Thinking. Dont be lazy and keep reading.

<h2>Problem Decomposition</h2>

<p>
	When a problem appears we usually look it as a whole and hope the solution will magically come. Sometimes it works but with complex problems it wont and we need to break the problem in mini problems. There are some examples:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>You want to calculate how many days a course of 200 hours will take</strong><br>
		<p>
			That is not the biggest problem in the world but we have some variables to consider so lets solve part by part.<br>
			You work 8 hours per day; The percurse to your work take 30 minutes and you sleep  7 hours everyday. So:<br>
			<br>
			H_WORK = 8;<br>
			H_SLEEP = 7;<br>
			H_PERCUSE = 1;<br>
			H_COURSE = 200;<br>
			<br>
			HOURS_AVAILABLE = 24 - (H_WORK + H_SLEEP + H_PERCURSE);<br>
			HOURS_AVAILABLE = 24 - 16;<br>
			HOURS_AVAILABLE = 8;<br>
			<br>
			DAYS = H_COURSE / HOURS_AVAILABLE;<br>
			DAYS = 200 / 8;<br>
		   DAYS = 25;<br>
			<br>
			You will kill it in 25 days! Don't forget to drink water<br>
