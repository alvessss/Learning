<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
	Computational Thinking is an approach that looks for solve problems through several analysis such dissolve the problem into small and easiest problems and find patterns to predict possible behaviors. After trace the whole problem it's needed a well detailed step-by-step showing how to solve the problem so anyone can replicate those steps. That step-by-step is the main pillar of the Computational Thinking and its called Algorithm. The Computer Scients use the programming languages, basicly, to translate those algorithms into computer instructions in order to solve problems of any scale. Despite the name that approach is not exclusive to Computers Scients and is useful in many fields in Exact Sciences or even to solve  day-to-day problems.

<h2>Problem Decomposition</h2>

<p>
	When a problem appears we usually look it as a whole and hope the solution will magically come. Sometimes it works but with complex problems it wont and we need to break the problem in mini problems. There are some examples:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>You want to calculate how many days a course of 200 hours will take</strong><br>
		<p>
			That is not the biggest problem in the world but we have some variables to consider so lets solve part by part.<br>
			You work 8 hours per day; The percurse to your work take 30 minutes and you sleep  7 hours everyday. So:<br>
			<br>
			H_WORK = 8;<br>
			H_SLEEP = 7;<br>
			H_PERCUSE = 1;<br>
			H_COURSE = 200;<br>
			<br>
			HOURS_AVAILABLE = 24 - (H_WORK + H_SLEEP + H_PERCURSE);<br>
			HOURS_AVAILABLE = 24 - 16;<br>
			HOURS_AVAILABLE = 8;<br>
			<br>
			DAYS = H_COURSE / HOURS_AVAILABLE;<br>
			DAYS = 200 / 8;<br>
		   DAYS = 25;<br>
			<br>
			You will kill it in 25 days! Don't forget to drink water<br>
