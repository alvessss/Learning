<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
	Computational Thinking is an approach that looks for solve problems through several analysis such dissolve the problem into small and easiest problems and find patterns to predict possible behaviors. After trace the whole problem it's needed a well detailed step-by-step showing how to solve the problem so anyone can replicate those steps. That step-by-step is the main pillar of the Computational Thinking and is called Algorithm. The Computer Scients use the programming languages, basicly, to translate those algorithms into computer instructions in order to solve problems of any scale. Despite the name that approach is not exclusive to Computers Scients and is useful in many fields in Exact Sciences or even to solve  day-to-day problems.
